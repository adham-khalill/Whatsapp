# WhatsApp Flutter Chat UI

This Flutter project is a basic implementation of a **WhatsApp-style chat interface**. It includes a simple chat screen where users can send and display messages. The design is inspired by popular messaging apps, with a familiar layout for ease of use.

### How to Structure the Screens

You can follow this structure for creating a WhatsApp-like chat interface using Flutter:

#### 1. **Chat Screen**
This is the main chat interface that displays the conversation with a particular contact. You can structure it using:
- **App Bar**: Shows the contact's name, profile image, and options like calling, video chat, or settings.
- **Chat Bubbles**: These should represent the conversation. Flutter‚Äôs `ListView` can be used to display a series of message bubbles. 
  - **Outgoing Message** (sent by the user): Aligned to the right with a custom color/style.
  - **Incoming Message** (received from contact): Aligned to the left with a different color/style.
- **Text Input Field**: A bottom bar with a text field where the user can type a message and send it.
